=head1 svr_submit_correspondences

    svr_submit_correspondences [--url=<url>] [--cleanOnly] [--fixup] [--passive] <directory1> <directory2> ...

Locate all the correspondence files in the specified directories and submits
then to the Sapling Server. It is not a real SAS script and is intended for
internal use only.

This script assumes the directory is divided into subdirectories by genome ID.
Each correspondence file has the name of the target genome ID and is in a directory
with the name of the source genome ID. The script can also be used to clean an
existing directory of files that have already been submitted.

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item cleanOnly

If specified, then no correspondences will be submitted. Instead, files from the
directory that are redundant will be deleted.

=item passive

If specified, then only files for correspondences that don't already exist will
be submitted.

=item fixup

If specified, then only correspondence files that need to be flipped will be
submitted. This is a special fix to repair an error in a previous run.

=item parseFiles

If specified, then the correspondence files will be checked for errors but
not submitted.

=item url

The URL for the sapling server, if it is to be different from the default.

=item flatDirectory

If specified, then it is presumed that the target directory is not divided
into subdirectories. Instead, all the correspondence files are in a single
directory and the file name is the two genome IDs separated by a hyphen.
