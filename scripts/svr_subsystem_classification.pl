=head1 svr_subsystem_classification

Extend a set of subsystems names to classifications

Example:

    svr_subsystem_classification < table.with.ss-name.as.last.column > extended.table

=head2 Output

A table with one added columnns (comma-delimited list of category and sub-category).
Lines in the incoming table that do not match are written to STDERR.
