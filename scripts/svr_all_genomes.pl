=head1 svr_all_genomes

List the names and IDs of all the (complete) genomes.

There is no input.  The output is a file of genome names and genome IDs.

------
Example: svr_all_genomes -complete > complete_genomes.tbl

would produce a 2-column table.  The first column would contain the
names of all complete genomes, and the second the IDs of those genomes.
------

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item url

The URL for the Sapling server, if it is to be different from the default.

=item -complete

    If TRUE, only complete genomes will be returned. The default is FALSE (return all genomes).

=item -prokaryotic

    If TRUE, only prokaryotic genomes will be returned.

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a file where each line contains a genome name and a genome ID.
