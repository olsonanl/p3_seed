This tool takes as input two genome sets.  These will often be

    gs1    genomes for a specifis species (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes)
    gs2    genomes from the same genus, but different species

The tool picks random subsets of gs1 and gs2, computes signature families for
each pair of picks, then computes clusters of these families for each pick.

It does a set of iterations, saving the signature clusters for each iteration.

After running the set of iterations, it computes the number of times each pair
of signature families were in signature clusters.

It outputs the pairs of co-ocurring signature families, along with the
signature clusters computed for each iteration.

The output goes to a created directory.  Within that directory, the subdirectory

    CS

will contain the cluster signatures for each iteraion, and

    related.signature.families

is set to the predicted functionally-coupled pairs of families:

    [occurrence-count,family1,family2] sorted into descending order based on count.

Each CS/n file contains entries of the form

          famId1 peg1 func1
          famId2 peg2 func2
          .
          .
          .
          //

=head2 Parameters

There are no positional parameters.

Standard input is not used.

The additional command-line options are as follows.

=over 4

=item gs1

Genome set 1: a file containing genome ids in the first column
These genomes will be the onces containing signature families and clusters.

=item gs2

Genome set 2: a file containing genome ids in the first column

=item sz1

For each iteration pick a sample of sz1 genomes from gs1

=item sz2

For each iteration pick a sample of sz2 genomes from gs2

=item iterations

run this many iterations of random subsets of gs1 and gs2

=item output

a created directory that will contain the output

=item family

Type of protein family-- local, global, or
