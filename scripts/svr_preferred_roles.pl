=head1 svr_preferred_roles

Get preferred roles, translating functions into more
acceptable forms

------

Example:

    echo 83333.1 | svr_all_features peg | svr_function_of | svr_preferred_roles | cut -f1,3

would produce a 2-column table.  The first column would contain
PEG IDs for genes occurring in genome 3702.1, and the second
would contain the preferred functions of those genes.

------

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line 
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the function to be translated.  If the last column does not contain it,
then

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the function in each case.
use 

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing functions is not the last.

=item -d

This is used to print only lines in which the original and translated
functions differ.

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added (the translated function associated with the PEG).

Downstream of a cloned katG gene (EMBL:MTKATG). Differences are due to frameshift errors in the EMBL sequence and the use of an earlier start codon.
