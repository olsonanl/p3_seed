=head1 Compute Signature Families

This module computes genetic signature families. It takes as input two sets of genomes and searches for
families that are common in the first and uncommon in the second. The output is a hash mapping family IDs
to occurrence counts.

=head2 Public Methods

=head3 Process

    my $familyHash = P3Signatures::Process(\@gs1, \@gs2, $min_in, $max_out, $jobObject, $comment);

Compute the protein families that distinguish genome set 1 from genome set 2.

=over 4

=item gs1

Reference to a list of the IDs of the first genomes. The signature families must occur in most of these genomes.

=item gs2

Reference to a list of the IDs of the second genomes. The signature families must occur in few of these genomes.

=item min_in

The fraction of genomes in set 1 that must contain a signature family. A value of C<1> means all genomes must contain it.

=item max_out

The fraction of genomes in set 2 that may contain a signature family. A value of C<0> means no genomes can contain it.

=item jobObject (optional)

If specified, an object for reporting progress. It must support a I<Progress> method that takes text messages.

=item comment (optional)

Optional comment to add to each progress message.

=item RETURN

Returns a hash mapping the ID of each signature family to a 3-tuple consisting of (0) the number of genomes in set 1 containing
the family, (1) the number of genomes in set 2 containing the family, and (2) the functional role of the family.

=head3 PegInfo

    my $pegList = P3Signatures::PegInfo(\@families, \@genomes);

Return the peg information list for a set of families (usually signature families). For each family,
we list all the features in the family belonging to genomes in the list. For each feature, we include
the location information and the functional assignment.

=over 4

=item families

Reference to a list of protein family IDs.

=item batchSize

Batch size for requests to PATRIC.

=item genomes (optional)

Reference to a list of genome IDs. Only features from these genomes will be returned. If omitted, all features
will be returned.

=item RETURN

Returns a reference to a list of 7-tuples. Each tuple consists of (0) a family ID, (1) the
feature's functional assignment, (3) the feature ID, (4) the feature's contig ID,
(5) the starting offset, (6) the ending offset, and (7) the strand (C<+> or C<->).

=head3 Clusters

    my $pegClusters = P3Signatures::Clusters($pegInfo, $distance);

Compute the clusters from a peg information list. A cluster is a group of pegs in which each
is less than a certain distance from the next on the same contig. The distance is measured midpoint to midpoint.

The normal use of this method is to process the output of L</PegInfo>; however, it can process any list of
feature tuples in which the last 5 elements are a feature ID and the feature's location (contig, start, end,
strand). In this way it can be used to compute clusters in other applications.

=over 4

=item pegInfo

A reference to a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a constant number of information fields followed by
a feature ID and location information-- contig ID, starting location, ending location, and strand. If the
input is the list produced by L</PegInfo>, then there are two information fields-- family ID and function.

=item distance

The minimum acceptable distance between peg midpoints for them to be considered part of a cluster.

=item RETURN

Returns a reference to a list of clusters. Each cluster is a list of N-tuples, one per feature in the cluster,
consisting of the feature ID and the initial elements from that feature's pegInfo entry. If the input is
the list produced by L</PegInfo>, each feature tuple will be (0) feature ID, (1) family ID, and (2) function.
